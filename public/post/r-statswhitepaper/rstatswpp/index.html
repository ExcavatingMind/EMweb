Additionally, students with lower mathematics grades are likely to suffer from math anxiety; the feeling of nervousness surrounding any learnt topic revolving around mathematical comprehension (Zhang, Zhao, and Kong 2019). As numerous studies have suggested, math anxiety is strongly negatively associated with math performance (Khasawneh, Gosling, and Williams 2021). Lastly, psychology is becoming far more integrated with computer scientific concepts, e.g., programming in r; math and computer science ability are strongly positively associated (Sari, Sukmawati, and Zulkarnain 2018). Overall, numerous findings suggest that for psychology students to get the best out of their degrees and to truly comprehend psychological research methods, math ability must improve.\nMy experience\rThe predominant reason for this project beginning was my own experience with mathematical concepts and psychology. I did not particularly like maths during secondary school, nor did I care for it. However, as I have continued my education and moved to postgraduate psychology, I realised several things. First, most PhD roles that I like require a strong mathematical foundation. Second, when discussing maths with my peers, most of them had a strong negative reaction to maths. Lastly, when discussing math concepts with peers throughout the last four years, few had a strong understanding of mathematics (including myself). Thus, I saw an opportunity to improve this issue.\nR and stats\rOverall, I saw that if students were provided with accessible content, they could drastically improve their comprehension of difficult topics. Throughout my work as a tutor, I have constantly attempted to produce highly accessible content and provide students with every opportunity to improve their understanding. So, I thought if I could create content that my 14-year-old self would grasp, then, I would be created content that would greatly benefit other psychology students with low math understanding and high math anxiety.\nThe online book\rAbiding by the open science framework, the book is and always will be free to access.
