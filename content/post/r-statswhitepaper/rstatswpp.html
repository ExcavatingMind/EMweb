<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A psychology student’s math ability is strongly associated with their quantitative research method and math performance in assignments and research. However, psychology students tend to have a lower mathematics grade than students studying the core sciences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gibbs2010" role="doc-biblioref">Gibbs 2010</a>)</span>. Additionally, students with lower mathematics grades are likely to suffer from math anxiety; the nervous feeling surrounding any learnt topic revolving around math comprehension <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zhang2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zhang, Zhao, and Kong 2019</a>)</span>. As numerous studies have suggested, math anxiety is strongly negatively associated with math performance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-khasawneh2021" role="doc-biblioref">Khasawneh, Gosling, and Williams 2021</a>)</span>. Lastly, psychology is becoming far more integrated with computer scientific concepts, e.g., programming in r; math and computer science ability are strongly positively associated <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sari2018" role="doc-biblioref">Sari, Sukmawati, and Zulkarnain 2018</a>)</span>. Overall, numerous findings suggest that for psychology students to get the best out of their degrees and to truly comprehend psychological research methods, math ability must improve.</p>

<h2>My experience</h2>
<p>The predominant reason for this project beginning was my own experience with mathematical concepts and psychology. I did not particularly like maths during secondary school, nor did I care for it. However, as I have continued my education and moved to postgraduate psychology, I realised several things. First, most PhD roles that I like require a strong mathematical foundation. Second, when discussing maths with my peers, most of them had a strong negative reaction to maths. Lastly, when discussing math concepts with peers throughout the last four years, few had a strong understanding of mathematics (including myself). Thus, I saw an opportunity to improve this issue.</p>

<h2>R and stats</h2>
<p>Overall, I saw that if students were provided with accessible content, they could drastically improve their comprehension of difficult topics. Throughout my work as a tutor, I have constantly attempted to produce highly accessible content and provide students with every opportunity to improve their understanding. So, I thought if I could create content that my 16-year-old self would grasp, then, I would be created content that would greatly benefit other psychology students with low math understanding and high math anxiety.</p>

<h2>The online book</h2>
<p>Abiding by the open science framework, the book is and always will be free to access. Currently, I am hosting the book on github pages using the bookdown package in r. <a href="https://excavatingmind.github.io/RandStats/" title="https://excavatingmind.github.io/RandStats/">excavatingmind.github.io/RandStats/</a></p>
