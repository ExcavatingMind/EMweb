<p>Hello all, I hope you are doing well. This brief introductory post will outline what I want to achieve with my blogging website. I will outline these here.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To aid creating a professional web presence to demonstrate my skills as a hopeful psychology PhD candidate and subsequent postdoc researcher / lecturer.</p></li>
<li><p>To provide accessible and reproducible open psychology and data science content.</p></li>
<li><p>To support undergraduate and postgraduate psychology students by providing them with content that enhances their skills.</p></li>
<li><p>To make this site a hub for all my other projects that will be posted here. For example, I have book ideas that are being continuously developed and deployed.</p></li>
</ol>
