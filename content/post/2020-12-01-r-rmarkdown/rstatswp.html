<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The mathematical ability of a psychology student is strongly associated to their quantitative research method and math performance in assignments and when conducting research; however, psychology students tend to have a lower mathematics grade than students studying the core sciences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gibbs2010" role="doc-biblioref">Gibbs 2010</a>)</span>. Additionally, students with lower mathematics grades are likely to suffer from math anxiety; the feeling of nervousness surrounding any learnt topic revolving around mathematical comprehension <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zhang2019" role="doc-biblioref">Zhang, Zhao, and Kong 2019</a>)</span>. As numerous studies have suggested, math anxiety is strongly negatively associated with math performance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-khasawneh2021" role="doc-biblioref">Khasawneh, Gosling, and Williams 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
