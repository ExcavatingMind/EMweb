Hello all, I hope you are doing well. This brief introductory post will outline what I want to achieve with my blogging website. I will outline these here.

1. To aid creating a professional web presence to demonstrate my skills as a hopeful psychology PhD candidate and subsequent postdoc researcher / lecturer.

2. To provide accessible and reproducible open psychology and data science content.

3. To support undergraduate and postgraduate psychology students by providing them with content that enhances their skills.

4. To make this site a hub for all my other projects that will be posted here. For example, I have book ideas that are being continuously developed and deployed.
