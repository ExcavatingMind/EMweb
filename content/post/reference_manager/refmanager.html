<h1>What is a reference manager?</h1>
<p>A reference manager is typically a computer application that stores references and allows you to easily cite them in documents, e.g., word.</p>

<p>For psychology students, it is not uncommon to produce an assignment with more than 20 references. Without a reference manager, it would be difficult to keep track of each reference you have used and time-consuming to put each of these into a bibliography. A reference manager typically has a webclipper that allows you to save an article or webpage while you search the web. Once it is saved, the article can then be easily cited in a word processor, e.g., word. This saves you a tonne of time and allows you to easily access references. Below is an example of my reference manager. I have put each reference in a folder for each assignment. This allows me to have ease-of-access when organising and examining each reference.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition, most reference managers allow you to create notes of each saved article. Here you would be able to write some brief notes of each reference; for example, when I need to do something else but realise the article is important, I use a word system to organise importance (Gold Standard, Silver Standard, and Bronze Standard). When I go back to the folder, I can see which articles I need to prioritise regarding reading.</p>

<p>Hands down, I recommend Zotero. Zotero is not only open source (free) but it is constantly updated and improved. It has a webclipper, a pdf editor, and seamlessly integrates with word and libre office. Overall, Zotero has saved me hours of wasting my time formatting references by hand.</p>
